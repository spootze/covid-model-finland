# A half-hearted attempt at a probabilistic model of COVID-19 infections in Finland
**DISCLAIMER: DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANYTHING!**

Imperial College researches [have used Stan for an actual model on this](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/). This is a lightweight PyMC3 model to check if you can explain changes in R_0 due to decisions taken by the Finnish authorities (like isolating Uusimaa)
